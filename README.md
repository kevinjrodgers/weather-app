Weather App

This is a weather web application that shows the current and weekly temperature and weather conditions for a location. The user will input a location and the application will receive the input, find the latitude and longitude for the respective location, and then output the weekly forecast for the location. The current temperature, highest temperature for the day, lowest temperature for the day, and current weather will show first. The weekly forecast will show in the form of a list starting from the current day.

Technologies used:
    OpenWeatherMap's One Call API
    OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API
    Visual Code

One of the challenges I faced was how to implement the date. OpenWeatherMap's One Call API puts the date for each forecast in epoch time, so having to convert it was challenging.
